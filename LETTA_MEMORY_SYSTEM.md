# Letta-Inspired Memory System

DeepDive now includes a **Letta AI-inspired memory system** that remembers articles you've read and discovers intelligent connections between them.

## 🧠 What is Letta AI?

**Letta** (formerly MemGPT) is a platform for building stateful AI agents with long-term memory. It allows AI to remember conversations and context across sessions, much like human memory.

## ⚡ Our Implementation

We've implemented a **Letta-inspired memory architecture** that:

1. **Remembers every article** you analyze
2. **Extracts topics** automatically using AI
3. **Finds connections** between articles based on:
   - Shared topics/themes
   - Same authors
   - Related content
4. **Persists across sessions** (in-memory, upgradeable to database)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Memory Storage

```javascript
// Three-tier memory system
articleMemory       // URL -> Full article data
articleConnections  // Article -> Related articles
topicIndex         // Topic -> Articles with that topic
```

### Data Flow

```
Article Analyzed
      ↓
Extract Topics (Gemini)
      ↓
Store in Memory
      ↓
Find Connections (Compare with past articles)
      ↓
AI Explains Connections (Gemini)
      ↓
Display in "Connections" Tab
```

---

## 📊 What Gets Stored

For each article, we store:

```javascript
{
  url: "https://...",
  urlHash: "base64_hash",
  title: "Article Title",
  author: "Author Name",
  source: "nytimes.com",
  published_at: "2025-10-26",
  analyzed_at: "2025-10-26T12:34:56Z",
  summary: "AI-generated summary",
  bullets: ["Key point 1", "Key point 2", ...],
  topics: ["climate", "politics", "technology"],
  credibility_score: 0.85,
  credibility_label: "Reliable"
}
```

---

## 🔗 Connection Discovery

### How Connections Are Found

1. **Topic Overlap**
   - Articles with 1+ shared topics are connected
   - More shared topics = stronger connection

2. **Same Author**
   - Articles by the same author get +2 strength bonus
   - Helps track author patterns and biases

3. **AI Explanation**
   - Gemini generates a human-readable explanation
   - Example: "Both articles discuss climate policy and renewable energy solutions"

### Connection Strength

```
Strength = Shared Topics + (Same Author ? 2 : 0)

Examples:
- 3 shared topics = Strength 3
- 2 shared topics + same author = Strength 4
- Same author only = Strength 2
```

Top 5 strongest connections are shown.

## 🎨 UI Features

### Connections Tab

Shows related articles you've previously read:

```
🔗 Related Articles You've Read
Articles connected by topic, author, or theme

[1] Climate Policy in the 2024 Election
    NYTimes • Oct 20, 2025
    🔗 Both articles discuss renewable energy policy
    [climate] [politics] [energy]

[2] The Future of Solar Power
    The Guardian • Oct 18, 2025
    🔗 Both analyze clean energy technologies
    [climate] [technology] [solar]
```

### Features:
- Numbered list of connections
- Clickable article titles (open in new tab)
- Connection reason (AI-generated)
- Topic tags
- Source and date
- Hover effects

---

## 🚀 Topic Extraction

### How Topics Are Extracted

Uses Gemini to analyze:
- Article summary
- Key bullet points
- Content themes

Returns 3-5 topics as single words or short phrases:
```javascript
["climate change", "renewable energy", "policy", "technology"]
```

### Benefits:
- Automatic categorization
- No manual tagging needed
- Consistent topic naming
- Semantic understanding (not just keywords)

---

## 💾 Storage & Scalability

### Current: In-Memory

```javascript
const articleMemory = new Map();
const articleConnections = new Map();
const topicIndex = new Map();
```

**Pros:**
- Fast access
- No database setup
- Perfect for development

**Cons:**
- Lost on server restart
- Limited to server memory
- Not multi-instance safe

### Future: Database Upgrade

Easy to upgrade to PostgreSQL/MongoDB:

```javascript
// Instead of Map
await db.articles.insert(articleData);
await db.connections.insert(connectionData);
await db.topics.insert(topicData);
```

Would enable:
- Persistent storage
- Multi-user support
- Cloud deployment
- Historical analytics

## 📡 API Endpoints

### `GET /history`

Get list of analyzed articles:

```javascript
// Response
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "url": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "analyzed_at": "...",
      "topics": [...],
      "credibility_score": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "total": 42
}
```

Returns last 50 articles, sorted by most recent.

### `GET /connections/:urlHash`

Get connections for a specific article:

```javascript
// Response
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "url": "...",
      "title": "...",
      "connectionReason": "Both discuss...",
      "connectionStrength": 4,
      "topics": [...],
      "analyzed_at": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Returns up to 5 most relevant connections.

## 💡 Why This Matters

### Traditional Reading:
❌ Forget what you've read  
❌ Don't see connections  
❌ Read in isolation  
❌ No context across sources  

### With Memory System:
✅ Remember everything  
✅ Automatic connections  
✅ Build knowledge graphs  
✅ Cross-reference sources  

---

## 🏁 Getting Started

**It just works!** No configuration needed.

1. Read an article → Analyzed & stored
2. Read another article → Connections found automatically
3. Click "Connections" tab → See related articles

The more you use it, the smarter it gets! 🧠

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Connection Sensitivity

In `server.js`:

```javascript
// Current: Top 5 connections
return connections.sort((a, b) => b.strength - a.strength).slice(0, 5);

// Show more:
.slice(0, 10);

// Minimum strength threshold:
.filter(c => c.strength >= 2)
```

### Change Topic Count

```javascript
// Current: 3-5 topics
"extract 3-5 main topics"

// More topics:
"extract 5-8 main topics"
```

---

## 📈 Performance

### Speed
- **Topic extraction**: ~1-2 seconds
- **Connection finding**: ~2-5 seconds (scales with # articles)
- **Total overhead**: ~3-7 seconds per article

### Optimization Tips

1. **Async storage**: We store in background, doesn't block response
2. **Smart comparison**: Only checks last 20 articles
3. **Early filtering**: Topic overlap check before AI comparison
4. **Parallel AI calls**: Can batch connection checks

## 🎓 Learning From Letta

### What We Borrowed:

✅ **Long-term memory** - Persist article data  
✅ **Intelligent retrieval** - Find relevant connections  
✅ **Context building** - Build knowledge over time  
✅ **Stateful agents** - Memory influences future analysis  

### What We Simplified:

❌ No separate Letta service (built-in)
